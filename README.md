# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It uses HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and Ajax front-end with a Node, Expres and MongoDB back-end. Users can tweet their thoughts, which are added to the list of tweets in order. Tweets cannot be added if they are over 140 chacaters long. 

The App is both web and mobile friendly.
